This cigar is one of my favorites, which is why I decided to review it first on this website. It has a pretty simple set of flavors and aromas that agree very well with me (leather, dry oak, and baking spices). However, it tastes like a much more expensive cigar than this description might suggest.

Named after Melanio Oliva, the patriarch to whom the brand traces its roots, the cigar features a fermented blend of ligero fillers. It's pretty clear from the name and the price that Oliva intends for this cigar to be special. The different vitolas vary in price from $8.80 for the petit corona, all the way up to $15.60 for the double toro and figurado vitolas.

- **Prelight Aroma**: I'm picking up some simples notes of dry wood and hay
- **Prelight Draw**: The draw is medium-loose, with notes of sweet dry wood and grass
- **Inital light**: Dry wood, oak, and a quick taste of dry mustard seed that quickly fades away
